## Turn on the Music while viewing 🎵

To enhance your experience while visiting my profile, I recommend turning on the music "Sunflower" by Post Malone. It will add a delightful touch to your browsing experience.
Tap on the music icon to turn on the music.

## Personalised Music Player 🎵

A Portfolio is something that tells us about a person. So, to know my music taste, I recommend turning on my playlist. A person's music taste tells us more about his emotional thoughts. Tap on the music player icon to view.
